    <h1>The Replacements</h1>

    <p>
        The Replacements was an 80s indie sensation, known across the country for their wild antics and complete inability to "play the game" of appeasing the music industry. Originally formed in Minneapplis, they are often considered by music enthusiests and critics to be a fascinating example of what-could-have-been. In an ironic twist of fate, the erratic and strong willed personalities that gained them their cult following ultimately also kept them from true mainstream success, and eventually led to the downfall of the band. Despite their climactic commercial failure, the band still lives on in through influence and infamy.

        The band was originally formed by brothers Bob and Tommy Stinson, with Tommy being just 11 years old at the time, and High School dropout Chris Mars. Paul Westerberg was invited to join after happening upon the band practicing in their garage by chance, and then making a habit of stopping by to listen in after his day working as a janitor. Westerberg steered the band into a more contemporary punk rock direction by introducing them to first-generation English punk bands such as the Clash. After much time spent getting banned from performing in church halls, the band eventually got their break by selling their first four-song demo tape to Peter Jesperson, the founder of the now iconic Twin/Tone records.
